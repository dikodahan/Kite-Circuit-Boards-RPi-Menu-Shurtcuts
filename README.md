# RetroPie Menu Shurtcuts for Kite's Circuit Board

In case you are not familiar with these projects, please visit www.sudomod.com. The AIO (All In One) boards for GameBoy and VMu also come with an excellent HUD software provided by [Kite](https://github.com/kiteretro). There are two functions that require manual intervention in his HUD:
* Enabling/disabling the on-screen baterry monitor.
* Running the HUD update software.

This setup script will update your image and add two RetroPie menu shortcuts to make it easy and simple to access these two features without the need to SSH into the system.

Example of the HUD Update configuration menu item:

Example of the Battery Monitor configuration menu item:

- Installer script originally built by [Kite](https://github.com/kiteretro) for the Circuit Sword but has been re-purposed to install the menu shurtcuts in RetroPie.
